# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the existing Gemini CLI project into "Next Mavens", a command-line AI workflow tool that connects to local LLM services (LM Studio and Ollama) instead of requiring external API keys. The system will automatically discover available models from these local services and allow users to select which model to use for their AI-powered development workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the CLI with local LLM models so that I can run AI-powered development workflows without requiring external API keys or internet connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the CLI THEN the system SHALL connect to local LM Studio and/or Ollama services instead of external APIs
2. WHEN local services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages indicating which services are not accessible
3. WHEN the user runs commands THEN the system SHALL process requests using the selected local model without requiring API keys

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically discover available models from my local LM Studio and Ollama installations so that I can easily select which model to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CLI starts THEN the system SHALL scan both LM Studio (default port 1234) and Ollama (default port 11434) for available models
2. WHEN models are found THEN the system SHALL present a list of available models with their source service (LM Studio or Ollama)
3. WHEN no models are available THEN the system SHALL display helpful instructions for setting up LM Studio or Ollama
4. WHEN the user selects a model THEN the system SHALL save this preference for future sessions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use "next-mavens" as the command name instead of "gemini" so that the tool reflects its new identity and purpose.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user installs the package THEN the system SHALL provide a "next-mavens" command instead of "gemini"
2. WHEN the user runs "next-mavens" THEN the system SHALL start the CLI with the same functionality as before
3. WHEN the user sees help text or documentation THEN all references SHALL show "Next Mavens" instead of "Gemini"

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle different model capabilities from LM Studio and Ollama so that I can use various model types effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to LM Studio THEN the system SHALL use the OpenAI-compatible API format
2. WHEN connecting to Ollama THEN the system SHALL use the Ollama-specific API format
3. WHEN a model doesn't support certain features THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle limitations and provide appropriate feedback
4. WHEN switching between models THEN the system SHALL adapt its communication protocol accordingly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure custom ports and hosts for my local LLM services so that I can use non-standard setups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user has custom LM Studio or Ollama configurations THEN the system SHALL allow specifying custom host and port settings
2. WHEN custom settings are provided THEN the system SHALL use these instead of default values
3. WHEN custom settings are invalid THEN the system SHALL fall back to defaults and warn the user
4. WHEN settings are changed THEN the system SHALL persist these preferences for future use

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all branding and references updated from Gemini to Next Mavens so that the tool has a consistent new identity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any user-facing text THEN all references SHALL use "Next Mavens" instead of "Gemini"
2. WHEN looking at package names THEN they SHALL reflect the new branding (e.g., @nextmavens/cli)
3. WHEN accessing configuration directories THEN they SHALL use ".nextmavens" instead of ".gemini"
4. WHEN viewing documentation THEN all examples and references SHALL use the new branding
5. WHEN checking window titles and UI elements THEN they SHALL display "Next Mavens" branding

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to provide clear feedback about model performance and availability so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model request fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages indicating the cause
2. WHEN models are slow to respond THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators
3. WHEN services become unavailable during use THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect and notify the user
4. WHEN multiple models are available THEN the system SHALL display performance characteristics to help with selection
